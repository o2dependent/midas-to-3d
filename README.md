# Purpose

Playing with midas to generate 3d objects from photos

## How to run

Create conda env -> install packages -> `python midascv_pic.py` -> cd web && bun install && bun dev

Go to the port hosted (http://localhost:4321 unless port is occupied) and see the mapped depth map.

Currently the path for the input image is hard coded so change that if you'd like to do different photos.
